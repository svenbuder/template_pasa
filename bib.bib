@article{Buder2018,
	abstract = {{The Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey is a large-scale
stellar spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way, designed to deliver
complementary chemical information to a large number of stars covered by
the Gaia mission. We present the GALAH second public data release (GALAH
DR2) containing 342 682 stars. For these stars, the GALAH collaboration
provides stellar parameters and abundances for up to 23 elements to the
community. Here we present the target selection, observation, data
reduction, and detailed explanation of how the spectra were analysed to
estimate stellar parameters and element abundances. For the stellar
analysis, we have used a multistep approach. We use the physics-driven
spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to derive stellar
labels (T$_{eff}$, log g, [Fe/H], [X/Fe], v$_{mic}$, vsin i,
A\_$\{$K\_S$\}$) for a representative training set of stars. This information is
then propagated to the whole sample with the data-driven method of The
Cannon. Special care has been exercised in the spectral synthesis to
only consider spectral lines that have reliable atomic input data and
are little affected by blending lines. Departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for several key elements,
including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS stellar
atmosphere models. Validation tests including repeat observations, Gaia
benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic
targets lend confidence to our methods and results. Combining the GALAH
DR2 catalogue with the kinematic information from Gaia will enable a
wide range of Galactic Archaeology studies, with unprecedented detail,
dimensionality, and scope.

@article{Buder2019,
	abstract = {{The overlap between the spectroscopic Galactic Archaeology with HERMES
(GALAH) survey and Gaia provides a high-dimensional chemodynamical space
of unprecedented size. We present a first analysis of a subset of this
overlap, of 7066 dwarf, turn-off, and sub-giant stars. These stars have
spectra from the GALAH survey and high parallax precision from the Gaia
DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution. We investigate correlations between
chemical compositions, ages, and kinematics for this sample. Stellar
parameters and elemental abundances are derived from the GALAH spectra
with the spectral synthesis code SPECTROSCOPY MADE EASY. We determine
kinematics and dynamics, including action angles, from the Gaia
astrometry and GALAH radial velocities. Stellar masses and ages are
determined with Bayesian isochrone matching, using our derived stellar
parameters and absolute magnitudes. We report measurements of Li, C, O,
Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, as well as
Ba and we note that we have employed non-LTE calculations for Li, O, Al,
and Fe. We show that the use of astrometric and photometric data
improves the accuracy of the derived spectroscopic parameters,
especially log g. Focusing our investigation on the correlations between
stellar age, iron abundance [Fe/H], and mean alpha-enhancement
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] of the magnitude-selected sample, we recover the result
that stars of the high-{$\alpha$} sequence are typically older than stars
in the low-{$\alpha$} sequence, the latter spanning iron abundances of -0.7
$\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ +0.5. While these two sequences become
indistinguishable in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] at the metal-rich regime,
we find that age can be used to separate stars from the extended
high-{$\alpha$} and the low-{$\alpha$} sequence even in this regime. When
dissecting the sample by stellar age, we find that the old stars ($\gt$8
Gyr) have lower angular momenta L$_{z}$ than the Sun, which
implies that they are on eccentric orbits and originate from the inner
disc. Contrary to some previous smaller scale studies we find a
continuous evolution in the high-{$\alpha$}-sequence up to super-solar
[Fe/H] rather than a gap, which has been interpreted as a separate
``high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich'' population. Stars in our sample that are
younger than 10 Gyr, are mainly found on the low {$\alpha$}-sequence and
show a gradient in L$_{z}$ from low [Fe/H] (L$_{z}$ $\gt$
L$_{z, &sun;}$) towards higher [Fe/H] (L$_{z}$ $\lt$ L$_{z,
&sun;}$), which implies that the stars at the ends of this sequence
are likely not originating from the close solar vicinity.
