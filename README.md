## How do I use it?

I like to keep papers and analysis scripts online to be able to share code and text with others. That means I have my data (data/), my code (*.ipynb) and the figures (figures/*.png or figures/*.pdf) that it produces in the same repository as my manuscript (*.tex). The combination of GitHub and Overleaf allows you to write your analysis code locally, your manuscript online and easily keep everything synchronised.

### Create GitHub and Overleaf accounts

Before you interact with this template, I suggest to sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). Most universities have agreements with both partners that give you free access to educational/professional accounts (including GitHub Copilot) if you use your university email address. To connect them, you have to link your GitHub account to your Overleaf one.

### Create a new GitHub repository for your research project based on this template

You can then copy this template as a new GitHub repository into your space by clicking onto the green button "Use this template" -> "Create new repository" and give it a descriptive name. If you do not want to share your work with the world yet, make sure to mark it as "Private" and not "Public".

### Clone your new repository onto your local (super-)computer

You will code locally either on your own or a supercomputer/high-performance computing facility (HPC). For that purpose, you need to clone your new repository onto your (super-)computer and should create a token between your computer and GitHub so that you can upload (git add/commit/push) files to the online repository.

Keep in mind that for a research paper, you want to also publish your code (it is not compulsory, but a good scientist should do it for reproducibility). That also means to code and comment well. Nowadays that is much easier thanks to Jupyter notebooks â€” so make use of the commenting functions and subtitles that you can include in these notebooks. If you use VSCode, you can also implement GitHub Copilot as an extension for faster and better-commented coding through AI-support.

### Import your new repository into Overleaf.

The last step of setting your project up is to import the repository from GitHub into Overleaf. To do that, click on *New Project* -> *Import from GitHub* and find the right repository.

Good luck with your research.
